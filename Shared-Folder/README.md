# Shared-Folder

Used to share files from your hypervisor host (for me, windows 11) to the virtual machine. 

I have these scripts: 


```
./ps1/1-configure-ip-dc.ps1
./ps1/2-configure-ip-srv01.ps1
./ps1/3-configure-ip-srv02.ps1
./ps1/4-configure-ip-client.ps1
./ps1/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1
./bash/lin-srv01-eth1.sh
